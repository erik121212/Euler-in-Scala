## EULER Project ##

This projects contains the first few solutions for the [Project Euler ](http://https://projecteuler.net/) implemented in [Scala ](http://www.scala-lang.org/)


**Criteria**:

- Code should work
- Code should be *as clean as possible* (e.g. use high order functions in stead of old fashioned loops and variable assignments


**Next step:**

- Code should be testable
- Make the code execute **as fast as possible**, so later on [Akka](http://akka.io/) will be added.
